# SpaceXLaunches
A KMP application to display information about SpaceX rocket launches based on this tutorial
https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Networking%20and%20Data%20Storage%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatfrom%20Mobile/01_Introduction

We will create a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) application for Android and iOS that includes a module with shared code for both platforms.
The application will retrieve data over the internet from a public API, save it in a local database, and display it in a list in the application.
We will implement business logic and data access layers only once in the KMM module, while the UI of both applications will be native.
We will use the SpaceX API, which provides public access to information about SpaceX rocket launches.
The SpaceX API has detailed documentation. Our application will display a list of rocket launches together with the launch date, results, and a detailed description of the launch.
This is what our applications will look like
